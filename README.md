# PharmaHacks 2025: Multiple Sequence Alignment for Antimicrobial Resistance ðŸ§¬

## Overview
This repository contains our solution for the PharmaHacks McGill 2025 challenge, **"Multiple Sequence Alignment for Antimicrobial Resistance"**. 

## Problem Description
Antimicrobial resistance is a phenomenon that occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, germs or viruses develop the ability to resist drugs that are used to
treat them. It usually happens when a drug has been overprescribed. This is very problematic as designing new drugs is time-consuming and very expensive. To avoid this problem, a technique has become more and more popular: **multiple sequence alignment (MSA)**. However, MSA is an NP-hard problem, making it computationally challenging. 

Citizen science initiatives, such as **Borderlands Science**, have shown that human intuition can be very effective in solving parts of these challenges, and our approach aims to mimic that human expertise using machine learning.
